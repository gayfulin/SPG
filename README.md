The Stochastic Pattern (i.e. random field) Generator (SPG) produces spatio-temporal pseudo-random Gaussian fields that satisfy the ``proportionality of scales'' property (Tsyroulnikov, Quart. J. Roy. Meteorol. Soc., 2001). The SPG is based on a third-order in time stochastic differential equation with a pseudo-differential spatial operator defined on a limited area 2D or 3D domain in the Cartesian coordinate system. The generated pseudo-random fields are homogeneous and isotropic in spacetime (with the scaled vertical and temporal coordinates). The correlation functions in any spatio-temporal direction belong to the Matern class. The spatio-temporal correlations are non-separable. A spectral-space numerical solver is implemented and accelerated exploiting properties of real-world geophysical fields, in particular, smoothness of their spatial spectra. The SPG is designed to create additive or multiplicative, or other spatio-temporal perturbations that represent uncertainties in numerical prediction models in geophysics.
