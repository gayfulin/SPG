This project contains source code of the Stochastic Pattern Generator (SPG)
developed by Dmitry Gayfulin and Michael Tsyrulnikov.

The SPG produces spatio-temporal pseudo-random Gaussian fields that satisfy the ``proportionality of scales'' property 
(Tsyroulnikov, Quart. J. Roy. Meteorol. Soc., 2001). The SPG is based on a third-order in time stochastic 
differential equation with a pseudo-differential spatial operator defined on a limited area 2D or 3D domain 
in the Cartesian coordinate system. The generated pseudo-random fields are homogeneous and isotropic in spacetime 
(with the scaled vertical and temporal coordinates). The correlation functions in any spatio-temporal direction belong to the Matern class. 
The spatio-temporal correlations are non-separable. A spectral-space numerical solver is implemented and accelerated 
exploiting properties of real-world geophysical fields, in particular, smoothness of their spatial spectra. 
The SPG is designed to create additive or multiplicative, or other spatio-temporal perturbations that represent uncertainties 
in numerical prediction models in geophysics.
